Users won't be able to add More than 8 chocolates in the customized box . In the customized box the user will be able to see the total no quantity added and the price of the customized box .

Then User can add the customized box to the cart by clicking on the add to cart button and after that a modal will appear with all the cart details and from there he can place his order.
